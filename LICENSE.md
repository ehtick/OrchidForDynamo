Since the use of the software may be seen as a conflict of interest for the author, the use of the license may be limited where a professional work-related conflict of interest may arise. Such cases may be the case in the geographical immediate environment, where the author acts professionally and must live off the intellectual property rights in the form of job security/consultancy. It will also be seen as a conflict of interest if the author experiences personal bothering or other harassment from any user or company. In case of conflict of interest, it will block the use of the Orchid solution for the user/company until a solution can be found.
