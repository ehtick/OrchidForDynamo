**Versioning:** Number syntax: Major.Minor.Build.Revision (x.x.x.x).  
The major and minor number follows the Dynamo version, e.g. Orchid 2.19.x.x is usable in Dynamo 2.19.x.x versions. The build number is internal major builds. The revision number is an internal build number without public documentation and display in this file.
